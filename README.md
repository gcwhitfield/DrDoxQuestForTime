Temporal rifts have opened up everywhere inside of Dr.Dox's laboratory! If the rifts aren't closed soon, then they will destroy the universe. Oh no!


Controls:

WASD - movement


How to play:

Move Dr.Dox towards the switch to begin closing the time rift. After the switch has been struck, time will move in reverse. Dr.Dox must return to the ladder to escape. But be careful! Dr.Dox must NOT come into contact with his self from the past or else he will explode.

This is a submission for the Pittsburgh Global Game Jam 2022.
